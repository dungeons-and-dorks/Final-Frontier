# Project Mission
Ever since the first human was launched into space in 1961, humans have persistently launched rockets into space. These missions have met successes and failures, and the results of both are measured in the millions of dollars. Our goal with this project is to answer a basic question: *Has human space travel gotten more reliable over time?*

For this project we'll be using statistics to evaluate if space flight has gotten more reliable, as well as building classification models to be able to predict survivability of space craft.
